/* Problem Statement

A university has two types of students â€” graduate
students and research students. The University
maintains the record of name, age and programme of
every student. For graduate students, additional
information like percentage of marks and stream, like
science, commerce, etc. is recorded; whereas for
research students, additionally, specialization and years
of working experience, if any, is recorded. Each class
has a constructor. The constructor of subclasses makes
a call to constructor of the superclass. Assume that every
constructor has the same number of parameters as the
number of instance variables. In addition, every
subclass has a method that may update the instance
variable values of that subclass. All the classes have a
function display_student_info( ), the subclasses must
override this method of the base class. Every student is
either a graduate student or a research student.
Perform the following tasks for the description given
above using Java :
(i) Create the three classes with proper instance
variables and methods, with suitable inheritance.
(ii) Create at least one parameterised constructor for
each class.
(iii) Implement the display_student_info( ) method in
each class.
